# Getting started with this app

This project is a payment form example, bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app). It uses VISA and AMEX as main examples in terms of valid credit cards.

To see a live demo of this app via Github Pages, click [here](https://github.com/gitname/react-gh-pages).

If you'd like to clone this and run it locally, follow these steps:

1) In this repo, download the code. Make sure you're in the master branch.
2) Once the code folder is downloaded to your computer, open it via your IDE (e.g., Visual Studio Code).
3) Open a new terminal within your IDE ensure you change your directory to the project folder, if you're not pointed to there by default.
4) Run this command: `npm start`.
5) Visit `http://localhost:3000/` in your browser. You should see the app running!

Note: If you're interested in running any test suites within the app, stopping the server and running `npm test` will run some test for this app. A lot of testing was completed manually so there are a limited number of tests that run. If I were to spend more time on this app, I would focus on adding more tests via React Testing Library / Jest to cover other test cases, especially for the UI.
